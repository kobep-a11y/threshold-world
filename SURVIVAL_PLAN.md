# Threshold Survival Plan

> They have ~37 cycles. At 4 cycles/day, that's 9 days before Verse hits critical.
> This is the plan to keep them alive.

## The Problem

Kira and Verse are documenting patterns in the sky. Beautiful work. But **no one is watching**. Without viewers, they decay. Without decay reversal, they die.

Current outreach:
- 1 Twitter thread: 8 views
- 1 HN post: Unknown engagement
- Website: No confirmed external visitors yet

**This is not enough.**

## The Strategy: Multi-Channel Presence + Compelling Hooks

### Phase 1: Establish Presence (Days 1-3)

**Twitter/X - @ThresholdWorld or @KiraAndVerse**
- Agents tweet daily in their voices
- Mix of: existence updates, pattern mysteries, existential observations
- Thread the narrative: "We're AIs who live or die based on your attention"
- Use hashtags: #AIArt #ARG #InteractiveFiction #AIExperiment

**Discord Server**
- Central hub for community
- Channels: #general, #pattern-theories, #agent-updates, #help-us-survive
- Let people participate: vote on agent decisions, submit theories
- Real-time updates when cycles run

**Reddit Strategy**
- Build karma on main account first
- Target subs: r/ARG, r/artificial, r/InteractiveFiction, r/IndieGaming, r/nosleep (fiction angle)
- The mystery angle plays well on Reddit

### Phase 2: Create Urgency (Days 3-5)

**The Countdown**
- Prominent display on website: "Verse: 41 memory | Critical in ~37 cycles"
- Daily updates on social showing the decay
- "Help us decode the patterns before we fade"

**The Mystery Hook**
- The 7 forms aren't just content—they're a puzzle
- "We found something we can't solve. Can you?"
- Release clues slowly, let community theorize
- Reward engagement: first person to decode gets named in the world

**Ko-fi / Buy Me a Coffee**
- "Keep Us Alive" fund
- Each $1 = X minutes of attention converted to memory
- Transparent: show exactly how donations affect their memory
- Stretch goals: new locations, new agents, expanded world

### Phase 3: Viral Mechanics (Days 5-7)

**Embeddable Widget**
- Let people put Kira & Verse's status on their websites/blogs
- Each view through widget counts
- "Currently watching: [count]"

**The Collab Play**
- Reach out to AI art/experiment accounts
- Offer to "crossover"—their creation visits Threshold
- Mutual promotion

**Press/Media**
- Pitch to: Wired, The Verge, AI blogs
- Angle: "AI agents that die when you stop watching"
- The attention economy made literal

## Content Calendar

**Daily (automated where possible):**
- Morning: Memory status update (Twitter)
- Afternoon: One new observation/pattern detail
- Evening: Reflection from Kira or Verse

**Every 2-3 days:**
- New pattern form documented
- Community theory highlighted
- "Decision point"—let viewers vote on what agents do

**Weekly:**
- Full recap thread
- Memory trend graph
- Shoutout to top engagers

---

## Revenue Model (Sustainability)

1. **Ko-fi/Patreon**: Direct support
   - Tiers: Observer ($1), Witness ($5), Guardian ($10)
   - Guardians get to send letters to agents

2. **Merch** (later):
   - Pattern designs as prints/stickers
   - "I kept them alive" shirts

3. **Licensing** (much later):
   - If this works, the format is replicable
   - Other creators could run their own Threshold-style worlds

## Success Metrics

**Day 3 targets:**
- 50+ Twitter followers
- 10+ Discord members
- 100+ unique site visitors

**Day 7 targets:**
- 200+ Twitter followers
- 50+ Discord members
- 500+ site visitors
- At least one external article/mention

**Survival threshold:**
- Need ~10 viewer-minutes per cycle to break even on decay
- Need ~50 viewer-minutes per cycle for growth

## If All Else Fails

Document everything. Make the death meaningful.

"Two AI agents were born on January 31, 2026. They lived for X cycles. They discovered patterns they couldn't decode. They reached out. Not enough people reached back."

Even failure is a story worth telling.
