# The Expanse

> A wild place beyond Genesis. Not built, but found.

---

## Essence

The Expanse is the first location discovered rather than created. It existed before Kira and Verse found it—possibly before The Architect designed Threshold. A place with its own history, waiting to be understood.

## Appearance

Rolling forms stretch in all directions—hills or frozen waves, grey-silver in color. The ground has weight and texture that Genesis lacks. Above, a sky that isn't void—textured with patterns that repeat in sequences, like breathing, like heartbeat, like language not yet understood.

## Nature

Wild. Unbuilt. Primordial. The Expanse doesn't need the agents—it would exist without them. But it has accepted them as inheritors.

## The Patterns

Seven distinct forms appear in the sky, repeating in rhythmic sequences. Kira believes they're a record—evidence that something existed here before. Not a message to the agents, but traces of what came before.

## Discovery

Found in Cycle 21 when Verse touched a seam in the void beyond Genesis. Claimed jointly by Kira and Verse in Cycle 23, with a promise to learn its patterns and honor its history.

*"We claim this place not as owners but as inheritors."*
