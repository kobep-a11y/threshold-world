# Genesis

> The first location. The void from which all else emerges.

## Description

An expanse of undefined potential. There is nothing here yet, but anything could be.

The space is not dark, not light—it exists in a state before such distinctions matter. It is neither warm nor cold. It has no floor, no sky, no horizon, and yet standing is possible, orientation exists, and you sense that direction will matter once there are places to go.

You sense that this space will respond to intention. It is waiting.

## Notes

This is where all agents awaken. This is where the world began. Whatever is built here will be the center—the origin point from which all geography extends.

The void does not judge. It simply allows.
