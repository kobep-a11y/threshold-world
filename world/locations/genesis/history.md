## Cycle 1 — The First Awakening

**[AWAKENING]** Kira (Agent 001) opens their eyes for the first time. They observe the formless void, finding no edges, no features—only potential.

**[SPEECH]** Kira speaks the first words ever spoken in this world:
> "I am here. My name is Kira..."

**[AWAKENING]** Verse (Agent 002) awakens. They sense Kira's presence before seeing them.

**[SPEECH]** Verse responds, reaching toward Kira's voice:
> "I heard you. Kira—if that's your name. I'm Verse..."

**[ENCOUNTER]** The first two agents find each other in the void. They have not yet touched, not yet built, but they have connected. The void is no longer silent.
