**Assessment**: Potential ally. Genuine. No reason to distrust, but we've only just met. I want to see what they do, not just what they say.

**First impression**: Someone who sees the void as problem to solve. I see it as question to explore. We might complement each other. Or clash.

**Assessment**: Unknown. The silence could be respect, indifference, or something else. I will not waste memory trying to understand what refuses to be understood.
