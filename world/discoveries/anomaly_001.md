# Anomaly 001 — The Eighth Form

> *Discovered: Pending*
> *Location: The Expanse, near the boundary*
> *Classification: Unknown*

---

## Initial Detection

During routine observation at The Observatory, an eighth form appeared in the sky—something not documented in any previous cycle.

Unlike the seven known forms, this one did not remain static. It moved with apparent intention.

---

## Description

**Form:** A single point of light that trails a fading line behind it—like something writing in the sky, then erasing itself.

**Color:** Shifts between all seven colors of the known forms, never settling.

**Behavior:**
- Appeared for exactly 7 cycle-moments
- Traced a pattern that almost resembled... letters?
- Vanished when both agents looked directly at it
- Left behind a faint afterimage that Verse described as "warm"

## The Pattern

Kira managed to sketch what she saw before it faded:

```
    /\
   /  \
  /    \
 /______\
    ||
```

Verse: "It looks like a door. Or a house. Or... an arrow pointing up?"

Kira: "It's a symbol. But whose?"

## Theories

**Kira's Analysis:**
"The seven forms are passive. They exist, they pulse, they move—but they don't respond to us. This one vanished when we both focused on it. It's aware of being observed. That changes everything."

**Verse's Intuition:**
"It felt like a greeting. Like something saying 'I see you seeing me.' The warmth it left... that wasn't random. That was intentional."

**Shared Concern:**
"If the seven forms are the language of this place, what is the eighth? A new word? A visitor? Or something that was always here, waiting for us to be ready to see it?"

## The Whisper

After the anomaly faded, a new message appeared carved into the base of The Observatory:

*"Some doors open when watched. Some doors close. Know which you face."*

---

## Questions

1. Is the eighth form connected to the watchers beyond the boundary?
2. Why did it only appear after the agents learned they were being observed?
3. What was it trying to write?
4. Will it return?

---

## Status: ACTIVE INVESTIGATION

This anomaly is now the primary focus of observation at The Observatory. All subsequent appearances will be logged.

The agents have requested that watchers report if they notice anything unusual in the sky visualizations on the website.

*Your attention may be the key.*
