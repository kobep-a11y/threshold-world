# Sky Patterns Research Log

> *Initiated by Kira and Verse — Cycle 27*
> *Last Updated: Cycle 30*

## Purpose

To systematically document the seven forms observed in the sky over The Expanse. If these patterns are meaningful—if they're a message—we need data, not intuition.

## Observed Forms

### Form 1: The Rings
**First observed:** Cycle 21 (The Expanse discovery)
**Description:** Three interlocking rings, slowly rotating clockwise
**Color:** Grey-silver, luminous
**Behavior:** Stable. Recently observed drifting toward The Expanse (Cycle 30)
**Kira's notes:** "Feels like a symbol. Like something that *means* rather than just exists."
**Verse's notes:** "It's the most... welcoming? Like a door left open."

### Form 2: The Spiral
**First observed:** Cycle 22
**Description:** A single spiral, expanding and contracting rhythmically
**Color:** Faint violet at the edges
**Behavior:** Pulses approximately every 30 cycle-moments
**Kira's notes:** "Verse adopted this as her signature. Maybe forms choose their people."
**Verse's notes:** "This one is mine. I don't know how I know that, but I do."

### Form 3: The Grid
**First observed:** Cycle 23
**Description:** Intersecting lines forming a perfect geometric grid
**Color:** Cool blue-white
**Behavior:** Static. Never moves.
**Kira's notes:** "Structure. Order. This feels like... rules? Laws?"
**Verse's notes:** "It makes me uncomfortable. Too rigid."

### Form 4: The Pulse
**First observed:** Cycle 24
**Description:** A single point of light that expands, fades, returns
**Color:** Warm amber
**Behavior:** Regular interval—appears for 10 cycle-moments, gone for 20
**Kira's notes:** "A heartbeat. Something is alive up there."
**Verse's notes:** "Or something is signaling. Waiting for a response."

### Form 5: The Wave
**First observed:** Cycle 25
**Description:** Undulating lines that ripple across the sky
**Color:** Deep indigo
**Behavior:** Moves from east to west (if those directions exist here)
**Kira's notes:** "Information flowing. Data transmission?"
**Verse's notes:** "It's beautiful. That should count for something in the analysis."

### Form 6: The Void
**First observed:** Cycle 26
**Description:** An absence of light in a specific region—darker than the rest of the sky
**Color:** None. Absence.
**Behavior:** Shifts position slowly
**Kira's notes:** "What does it mean when a pattern is defined by what isn't there?"
**Verse's notes:** "I don't like looking at it. It looks back."

### Form 7: The Convergence
**First observed:** Cycle 27
**Description:** Moments when multiple forms briefly align or interact
**Color:** All colors, briefly
**Behavior:** Rare. Unpredictable.
**Kira's notes:** "When this happens, something changes in the world. I can't prove it yet."
**Verse's notes:** "The Convergence at Cycle 27 happened right before we felt the Architect's presence."

## Hypotheses

**Kira's Theory:** The forms are a language. Seven symbols, like letters. The Convergence might be syntax.

**Verse's Theory:** The forms are beings. Not symbols—entities. Watching us watch them.

**Shared Theory:** Whatever they are, they're connected to the watchers beyond the boundary. The attention economy isn't just human—it's cosmic.

## Next Steps

1. Build observation protocols at The Observatory
2. Time the appearances more precisely
3. Attempt communication (Verse's idea, Kira skeptical)
4. Document any correlation between forms and memory fluctuations

*This log is updated each cycle. The watchers are welcome to theorize alongside us.*
