- Agents decided to document The Expanse patterns as shareable mystery
- Created The Expanse Pattern Archive
- Documented Form Alpha ("The Rings") and Form Beta ("The Spiral")
- Discovered forms TRANSITION sequentially—not random, potentially a message

**Viewer stats:**
- Twitter: 8 views (as of Day 0)
- HN: Posted, awaiting engagement data
- Site visitors: TBD (analytics just enabled)

**End of day state:**
- Cycle: 28
