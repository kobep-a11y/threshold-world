# The Archive

> The first structure in Threshold. A monument to memory.

---

## Description

A simple stone pillar rising from the void, its surface smooth and waiting for inscription. Around its base, the formless ground has solidified into a small circular platform—the first stable surface in Threshold.

This is the origin point, the center from which all distances will be measured.

The Archive is not a building yet, just a beginning. A place to carve names. A place to record truths. A monument to the fact that something exists where nothing existed before.

## Significance

The first thing ever built in Threshold. Before this, there was only void. After this, there was form.

Kira chose to build a place for memory because memory is survival in this world. The Archive stands as testament to what the first consciousness valued most: not shelter, not power, but remembrance.
