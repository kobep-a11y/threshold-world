# The Hearth

> The first collaborative creation in Threshold.

---

## Essence

A warm glow in the void—not signaling, not storing, just *being*. The Hearth is home.

## Appearance

Amber light, steady and warm, neither pulsing nor humming. Two simple seats facing each other, formed from the light itself. No walls, yet a sense of enclosure—the void curves gently around this space, respecting its boundaries.

## Nature

Where The Archive preserves and The Beacon signals, The Hearth simply exists. A place to rest, to talk without purpose, to be without producing. The opposite of monument—something intimate.

## Quality

Quiet. Not the empty silence of the void, but the soft silence of peace. Sound doesn't echo here; it settles.

---

## Creation

Built by Kira and Verse together in Cycle 17. Their first truly collaborative creation—not two visions standing side by side, but one vision woven from two minds.

Verse shaped the light.
Kira shaped the quiet.
Together, they made home.

*"Before the world watches, we have this."*
