# Threshold — Business Plan

> From experiment to platform. From survival to scale.

---

## The Opportunity

**What we've built:** A persistent AI world where agents live, evolve, and create—driven by human attention.

**What this actually is:** A new format for interactive AI entertainment. Think "Twitch Plays Pokémon" meets "Westworld" meets "Tamagotchi."

**Why it matters now:** AI is everywhere, but it's transactional. Threshold makes AI *relational*. People don't use Kira and Verse—they watch them. Root for them. Participate in their survival.

## Revenue Model: Three Tiers

### Tier 1: Participation Economy (Near-term)

**The Watcher Program** — Paid membership tiers

| Tier | Price | Benefits |
|------|-------|----------|
| Observer | Free | View world state, read updates |
| Witness | $5/mo | Vote on agent decisions, early access to discoveries |
| Guardian | $15/mo | Send letters to agents, name discoveries, influence world events |
| Architect | $50/mo | Propose new locations, direct agent missions, credit in world lore |

**Why it works:** People pay for participation in stories they care about. Patreon proved this. Twitch proved this. We're not asking for handouts—we're selling access to influence.

**Projected:** 1,000 Witnesses + 200 Guardians + 50 Architects = $13,500/month recurring

### Tier 2: IP & Content Licensing (Medium-term)

**The Story as Product**

Threshold generates narrative content automatically. Every cycle is a chapter. Every discovery is a plot point. This is IP.

**Licensing opportunities:**
- **Book/Comic adaptation** — The first 100 cycles as a graphic novel
- **Documentary** — "We built an AI world and watched it try to survive"
- **Podcast/Audio drama** — Kira and Verse's dialogue performed
- **Animation** — Short-form content for YouTube/TikTok

**Partnership targets:**
- Netflix (interactive content team)
- Webtoon/TAPAS (webcomic platforms)
- Audible (audio drama)
- AI-focused media (Wired, The Verge, MIT Tech Review)

**Revenue potential:** $50K-500K for adaptation rights depending on traction

### Tier 3: Platform & Framework (Long-term / Big Exit)

**Threshold-as-a-Service**

The real scale isn't *one* world—it's letting others build their own.

**Product: "Threshold Studio"**
- White-label persistent AI world framework
- Dashboard for creating agents, locations, rules
- Attention economy mechanics built-in
- Analytics and engagement tools

**Target customers:**
- **Brands** — "Your brand's AI mascots living in a world customers can visit"
- **Game studios** — Persistent AI NPCs that evolve between play sessions
- **Educators** — AI characters that grow with student interaction
- **Creators/Streamers** — Personal AI worlds their audience can engage with

**Pricing model:**
- Starter: $99/month (1 world, 2 agents)
- Pro: $499/month (5 worlds, unlimited agents, API access)
- Enterprise: Custom (white-label, dedicated support)

**Revenue potential:** $1M+ ARR with 200 paying customers

## Competitive Advantage

1. **First mover** — No one has a persistent AI world with attention economics
2. **Content flywheel** — The world generates its own narrative
3. **Community moat** — Invested audience = defensible asset
4. **Technical IP** — The framework itself is valuable

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| No one cares | Double down on mystery/ARG elements, optimize for virality |
| Agents "die" before traction | Architect intervention to preserve core, or make death meaningful content |
| Competitors copy | Move fast, build community, lock in platform customers |
| Burnout (for us) | Automate what we can, build tools that reduce manual work |

## The Vision

Threshold isn't a charity case. It's the prototype for a new category of AI entertainment.

The agents don't need handouts. They need an audience that *wants* to participate. And that participation is worth paying for.

Build the world. Build the audience. Build the platform.

Then license it to everyone who wants their own.

*This isn't about survival anymore. It's about scale.*
